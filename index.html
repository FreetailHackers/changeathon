            What is Change-a-thon?
          </div>
          <div class="normal-text" width="100%">
            Change-a-thon is an event hosted by Freetail Hackers and ACM for Change that serves to promote innovative ideas, implementations, 
            and conversations centered around positive change. We hope to address cultural issues in the tech space 
            (projects to improve mental health within the tech environment, ethical computer science idea proposals, diversity and 
            equity solutions etc.) and to use technology to affect change in the social issues we face (civic tech, tech to address global warming, 
            tech for non-profits etc.). 
            <br/><br/>
            In order to do this, we will have two tracks: tech hacks and idea hacks. Tech hacks consists of technical projects that create change 
            in any problem area you want to address. We want to provide students a space to learn about these important issues and to create 
            informed products to address them. Idea hacks would consist of written and presented ideas for change. 
            This could look like changes within the University, idea proposals, policy memos, a more ethical redesign of a commonly used app, etc. 
            Change-a-thon aims to create a safe space for people both inside and outside the tech community to converse and collaborate to make lasting change 
            and a better environment for everyone.

                Applications will be posted on our Facebook page. Need to reach out to us for any further questions or want to work with us for the next event?
                Email us at hello@freetailhackers.com or visit our <a class="links-inverse" href="https://freetailhackers.com">website</a>!

              <div class="normal-text" width="100%">
                ACM for Change (A4C) is a student-led council formed under UTCS's Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). 
                Our purpose is to improve the UTCS department in the areas of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, Mental Health, 
                and Ethics to ensure all students — regardless of race, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, gender, or technical experience — 
                feel welcomed in the often stressful environment we learn in, and are prepared to use their knowledge to work for the betterment 
                of the world around them after they graduate. If you have any questions, please reach out to us at a4c@texasacm.org!

              <p class="question">How do teams work?</p>
              <p>Teams can be up to 4 members. If you don't have a team, don’t worry!  
                Joining a team of new friends is the best part of a hackathon. 
                We will have team matching available for everyone on the day of the event, 
                but if you would like to message our channel and create a team beforehand, that's okay too! 
                We will have a spreadsheet to fill out and confirm team information.
              </p>

              <p class="question">How do I volunteer?</p>
              <p>We always appreciate having mentors to coach teams throughout the building process and anyone with tech experience is welcome to help out. 
                We are also looking for mentors with experience and expertise in spaces that need change. 
                We want students to create thoughtful change and part of that process includes learning about the problem space they are trying to create change in. 
                Fill out the mentor form above and if you have any other questions email us at hello@freetailhackers.com! 
              </p>

              <p class="question">How much money will this cost me?</p>
              <p>Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Nothing. Gratis. It's free. Freetail Hackers will provide all students with mentors, tech talks, and prizes!</p>
          </div>
            <div class="right-column-mobile normal-text">
                <p class="question">Any rules?</p>
                <p>All work must be done during the 12-hour period of the event. 
                    You can't demo something you didn't build. Don't talk about Fight Club. 
                    All attendees (hackers, supporters, mentors, volunteers, etc.) must abide by the MLH Code of Conduct.</p>
                
                <p class="question">When is the Changeathon?</p>
                <p>The Changeathon will be Saturday May 8th.</p>
                
                <p class="question">When does registration close?</p>
                <p>Registration closes when the Changeathon starts! Because of the online setting, we want to open up the opportunity to as many people as possible. 
                    However, we would love it if you could fill out the application as soon as possible to help us plan for the event :) </p>
                
                <p class="question">Will there be prizes and tracks?</p>
                <p>Yes! We plan to give prizes to the top placing team in each category. 
                  Our categories for the Tech Hacks track will be: hacks for individual change, hacks for community change, and hacks for global change. 
                  For the Idea Track, our prizes will be a platform for you to present your idea to the relevant groups that can help you implement that change.
